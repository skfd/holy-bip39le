I want to make a web visualization of the search for valid bip39 phrases in given text.
it should be a static page with couple of books as examples.
visualization will show scrolling text of the book it will dynamically highlight words that are valid bip39. and if the sequence of bip39 words has a valid checksum it will have a shine animation (like a unique item in diablo, for example) and will generate an orb on the side that will float there and show the found phrase on hover.
there is a speed control, pause and rewind controls, with hotkeys.
this project is related to `~\Code\btc-bookinist` but should use javascript
